# Stock Price Return Predictor

This script uses a simple linear regression model to predict the future percentage returns of a stock based on its historical daily returns.

**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified model for educational purposes only. Financial markets are highly complex and unpredictable. **Do not use this tool for real investment decisions.**

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the `stock_prediction` directory.**

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    Provide the stock ticker symbol as a command-line argument.

    ```bash
    python stock_predictor.py <TICKER_SYMBOL>
    ```

    **Example:**
    ```bash
    python stock_predictor.py AAPL
    ```

## How to Improve the Model and Data

The current model is a basic proof-of-concept. Its predictive power is very limited. Here are some ways you could improve it:

### 1. Improve the Model

The current linear regression model only looks at the previous day's return, which is not enough to capture market complexity. Consider using more sophisticated models:

*   **Autoregressive Models (AR, ARMA, ARIMA):** These models are specifically designed for time-series data and can capture more complex time-based dependencies.
*   **GARCH Models:** These are used to model volatility and can be useful in finance.
*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially LSTMs or GRUs:** These are deep learning models that are excellent at learning from sequential data like time series. They can recognize complex, long-term patterns.
*   **Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM):** These are powerful ensemble methods that often perform well on structured data.

### 2. Improve the Data (Feature Engineering)

The model's predictions can be significantly improved by providing it with more data (features) to learn from. Instead of just using the previous day's return, you could add:

*   **Technical Indicators:**
    *   **Moving Averages (SMA, EMA):** Smooth out price data to identify trends.
    *   **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** A trend-following momentum indicator.
    *   **Bollinger Bands:** Measure market volatility.
*   **Lagged Features:** Instead of just the previous day's return, include returns from the last 3, 5, or 10 days.
*   **Volatility Measures:** Use historical volatility (e.g., standard deviation of returns) as a feature.
*   **Fundamental Data:** Incorporate company-specific data like P/E ratios, earnings reports, or revenue growth. (This would require a different data source).
*   **Market Sentiment:** Include data from news headlines or social media (e.g., using Natural Language Processing) to gauge market sentiment.
*   **Macroeconomic Data:** Add features like interest rates, inflation rates, or GDP growth, as these can influence the entire market.
